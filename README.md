# Project of Reconfigurable Circuits

Project-based learning of reconfigurable circuits and CHIP design using VHDL and Xilinx boards.

This repository stores some of the source codes developed in the Reconfigurable Circuits course (Projeto de Circuitos Reconfiguraveis @ UnB-Gama) during the 1/2017 semester.
